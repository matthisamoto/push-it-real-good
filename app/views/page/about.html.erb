<div class="about-us">

<p>Once up on a time, Ben and Matt were making a website for the interwebs.</p>

<p>To rejoice "pushing" their files live, Ben thought playing his favorite song would be the perfect celebration.</p>

<p>Matt proclaimed "How selfish! We should let others join in the frivolity of simplistic audio bliss from the tubes of the internet."</p>

<p>And with the help and hard work of Raleigh, Scott and Melati â€” Push It Real Good was born.</p>

<p>Merely pick a sound and button to create a simple gadget to play with anywhere you feel the urge...the urge to push it, real good.</p>
